
Data Analysis Workflow for Brent Oil Price Change Point Analysis
============================================================
1. Data Preparation:
   - Load Brent oil price data (1987-2022) from data/BrentOilPrices.csv.
   - Convert Date column to datetime, handling mixed formats (e.g., 20-May-87, Apr 22, 2020).
   - Handle missing values and outliers, if any.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Plot raw price series to identify trends and shocks.
   - Compute log returns to analyze volatility and check stationarity.
   - Perform statistical tests (e.g., ADF test) in Task 2.
3. Event Data Compilation:
   - Research 10-15 major events (geopolitical, OPEC, economic).
   - Save in data/events.csv with dates and descriptions.
4. Change Point Modeling (Task 2):
   - Use PyMC to implement Bayesian Change Point model.
   - Define priors for switch points and parameters (mean, volatility).
   - Run MCMC to estimate posterior distributions.
5. Interpretation (Task 2):
   - Align change points with events from events.csv.
   - Quantify price impacts (e.g., percentage change in mean).
6. Visualization and Dashboard (Task 3):
   - Build Flask/React dashboard to display trends and event impacts.
   - Include interactive features (filters, date ranges).
7. Reporting:
   - Summarize findings in a report or blog post for stakeholders.
