# Change Point Detection and Modeling for Brent Oil Prices

## Overview
This repository contains the code and deliverables for the 10 Academy Artificial Intelligence Mastery Week 10 Challenge (July 30 - August 5, 2025). The goal is to analyze Brent oil price data (1987-2022) to detect significant change points and associate them with major geopolitical, economic, and OPEC events using Bayesian Change Point modeling (PyMC). The project includes exploratory data analysis, event data compilation, Bayesian modeling, and an interactive Flask/React dashboard.

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains datasets (e.g., `brent_oil_prices.csv`, `events.csv`).
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and analysis (e.g., `task1_analysis.py`).
- `plots/`: Visualizations (e.g., price series, log returns).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory modeling (to be used in Task 2).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies.
- `workflow.txt`: Outlines the data analysis workflow for Task 1.
- `interim_report.md`: Interim submission report for Task 1.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yafetm/Change-point-detection-modeling-to-identify-shifts-and-causes-in-time-series-data.git
